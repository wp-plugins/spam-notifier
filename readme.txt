The plugin sends an email message when a comment goes to the spam folder.

== Description ==

The plugin sends you an email each time a comment goes to the spam folder. The plugin will come in handy in combination with anti-spam plugins like [Antispam Bee](http://wordpress.org/plugins/antispam-bee/), [Invisible Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/invisible-captcha/) and others that completely filter out comments from bots. It saves you the trouble of having to visit the "Spam" folder and manually check whether any real comments have been marked as spam by mistake.


We don’t recommend installing this plugin if you use [Akismet](http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/) only – you’ll be drowned in hundreds of emails every day.
